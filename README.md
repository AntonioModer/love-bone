# BÖNER: 2D Skeletal Animations for LÖVE
This is a sample LÖVE project to showcase BÖNER.

The library can be found in the boner (tee-hee) folder.
Test assets are in the guy folder.
Currently the only editor support is for Demina (a very simple 2D skeletal animation editor) because it was the easiest to get up-and-running.
The importer is in demina.lua. It is a hastily written parser to load skeletons/animations/skins made using Demina.
